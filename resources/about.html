    <h2>Wells In My Back Yard</h2>
    <p>
        WIMBY was an idea I had, quite a few years ago, after reading about an incident w.r.t. an
        improperly abandoned well in the community of Calmar, AB (more on that later). At the time,
        working with oil & gas data every day (in the development of
        <a href="http://etriever.com">etriever.com</a> and <a href="http://welltriever.com">welltriever.com</a>),
        I was appalled at the idea people could have an abandoned well in their back yard, and not
        be aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of the time this blurb was written, there were 803928 licensed wells in Canada (numbers courtesy of
        etriever.com).  That includes water/steam wells, but there were only ~16K of those, so they
        hardly count against that somewhat mind-boggling total.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of those 800K wells, over 250K of them were “abandoned”.  This is an official oil industry
        designation, wherein the wells are no longer being operated, and the mineral leases have been
        returned to the provincial government. These “abandoned" wells are not the “inactive” wells about
        which there has been much coverage in the news recently.<br/>

    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, there’s another 90K+ wells that have been “suspended”, which means they are not producing,
        but the operating company still maintains the mineral lease. In some cases, these wells are just
        awaiting improved economics, for them to be viable again.  In others, the operating companies
        have been bankrupted, and they are orphaned.  In both these cases, there would still be a caveat
        on any surface land title related to these wells, so they aren’t exactly “invisible".
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s those abandoned wells that are the problem WIMBY is intended to address, and most especially
        the old ones.  Once the operating company cleans up and the mineral lease is returned to the
        government, there is no requirement for the caveat to remain on the associated surface land
        title, so it falls off.  At this point, it is difficult to know that these wells even existed.
        They are, in effect, invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the wild-west past of the oil industry, there were no regulations about the abandonment of
        wells. In the 1960’s the rules and regulations around the abandonment of wells gained some teeth
        (1963, 1966), and have only become more stringent with time, so wells abandoned after that time
        are less likely to cause problems (although it’s still nice to know where they were, just in case).

    </p>
    <p>
        Previous to those regulations coming into effect, though, is a grey area. Some companies were good
        about properly closing these wells in, while others… were not. Thus the debacle at Calmar, AB.
        Although the original story link has disappeared, I documented the details in a
        <a href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/gas-leak-forces-out-families">blog post here</a>,
        when I first created a web application called WIMBY (that web app no longer exists).
    </p>
    <p>
        And there is ongoing coverage of the Calmar saga in many places:<br/>

    </p>
    <p>
    All the data presented in WIMBY (and much more) is available from the various provincial governments<br/>
    BC - <a href="https://www.bcogc.ca">https://www.bcogc.ca</a><br/>
    AB - <a href="https://www.aer.ca">https://www.aer.ca</a><br/>
    SK - <a href="http://www.economy.gov.sk.ca/oilgas">http://www.economy.gov.sk.ca/oilgas</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        But it remains difficult to find things, unless you already know where to look (go ahead and try:
        <a href="http://mapviewer.aer.ca/Html5/Index.html?viewer=aerabnwells">AER Mapviewer</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        And please, (really PLEASE), don’t expect me, the creator of WIMBY, to do anything about
        abandoned wells you might be concerned about. You should take those concerns & questions to the
        relevant provincial authority (as listed above).
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the important things I would ask you to remember, is that the currently responsible
        operator of these wells may or may not even be aware of their existence.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">
        "All three wells were initially drilled by Texaco, and have been out of use since the 1950’s.
        Imperial came into ownership of the wells in 1989, but was not aware of their presence until
        late 2007."<br/>

    </p>
    <p>
        I guess what I am trying to say here is, some of these wells were abandoned before the people
        currently responsible were even born, so try not to make them out as villains, ok?
    </p>
    <p>
        WIMBY is my attempt to make the information about Abandoned Wells in Canada easy to find and to
        put that information directly in the hands of anyone who wants to look. Hopefully, with this
        information in hand, we won’t ever need to have another Calmar incident.
